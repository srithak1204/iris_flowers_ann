# iris_ann.ipynb
This project implements a Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classifying images of animals. The goal is to accurately classify flower images. 
## Data set

## Features
-**Iris Flower Classification**:
The ANN is specifically designed to classify iris flowers into different species, such as setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

-**Multi-Class Classification**:
The model is trained to handle a multi-class classification task, distinguishing between the various iris flower species.

-**Input Data Handling**:
The network accommodates input features related to iris flowers, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

-**Customizable Input**:
The architecture allows for easy adaptation to different datasets or variations in feature representation.

-**Scalability**:
The project is designed to handle datasets of varying sizes, making it scalable for both small and large datasets of iris flower images.

-**Activation Functions**:
The choice of appropriate activation functions, such as ReLU or sigmoid, to introduce non-linearity into the network and capture complex relationships in the data.

-**Loss Function**:
Selection of an appropriate loss function, such as categorical cross-entropy, to measure the difference between predicted and true class probabilities during training.

-**Training Process**:
The ANN is trained using optimization algorithms like gradient descent or variants (e.g., Adam) to minimize the chosen loss function.
-**Validation and Testing**:
Incorporation of validation sets to monitor model performance during training and testing sets to evaluate final model accuracy and generalization.
## Model performance
Training accuracy: 96%
